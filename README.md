# vertex_color_transfer
This an addon for [Blender]([url](https://www.blender.org/)), the 3d animation/modeling software.

It allows copying vertex colors from one color attribute to another, through the context menu.

Users can

2. copy/paste all the channels at once
3. copy/paste a greyscale version of the combined channels.
